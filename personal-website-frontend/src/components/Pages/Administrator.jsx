                I have worked for over a decade in Arts administration, doing every role from volunteer to Interim Executive director. Along the way I have expertly honed my understanding of what an arts organization needs to be successful, and how to actively listen, meaningfully collaborate, and support teams with sensitivity and success in fast-paced, dynamic environments.

                My mission is to enable myself and others to engage with the arts in meaningful and exciting ways.

                Throughout my career, I have overseen the production of hundreds of concerts, workshops, and public events, recruiting and leading teams of over 100+ volunteers, building and maintaining relationships with dozens of partner organizations, in order to create stunning, engaging events for thousands of people.
