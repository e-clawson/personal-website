# personal-website

# Overview 
This is a personal project to setup a simple personal website that I can use to practice my basic coding skills (css and styling, html, javascript and react, backends, etc.), practice thinking through a project and planning a project, and to share on job applications, my resume, and my linkedIn, etc. 

# Goals 

With this project, the user will be able to: 
- open a home page/landing page with a navbar 
- navigate to an about me page, and a projects page 
- navigate to a resume page 
- reach - fill out a contact form, and have the message show up on the page on submit 

I am still trying to decide if I want to use bootstrap or make all the design myself 

# Timeline 

Here's the working plan: 

Here is the timeline of my actual work: 

- Jul 30, 2025 - started the project and set-up the project structure - built the front-end and backend and connected to github - began the planning process for goals, deliverables, and timeline.
